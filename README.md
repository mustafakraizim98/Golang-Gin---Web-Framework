# Golang-Gin---Web-Framework
Gin is a high-performance micro-framework that can be used to build web applications and microservices. It makes it simple to build a request handling pipeline from modular, reusable pieces. It does this by allowing you to write middleware that can be plugged into one or more request handlers or groups of request handlers.
